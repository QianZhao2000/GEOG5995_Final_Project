 Project: Is there a correlation between harbor size and the volume of maritime traffic in the UK?

## Background
In an era where maritime transport plays a crucial role in global trade, understanding the dynamics of harbor activities is important. The United Kingdom, with its extensive coastline and historical significance as a maritime nation, presents a unique landscape to study these dynamics. Our project, "Is there a correlation between harbor size and the volume of maritime traffic in the UK?", seeks to clarify the relationship between the physical size of harbors and the volume of maritime traffic they handle.

## Data
we use three key datasets including two spatial datasets and one non-spatial dataset. 
#### 1. UK Map Data [2]:
This dataset provides us with a base with the geographical context. It is necessary to accurately plot and analyze maritime activity in the UK.
#### 2. Ports Data [3]:
This dataset displays the geographical distribution of ports in the United Kingdom. This spatial dataset is critical for identifying and visualising the particular locations of marine ports, which are the focus of our investigation.
#### 3.  Maritime Traffic Data [4]:
This dataset contains the non-spatial statistics for our analysis including detailed information about the volume of maritime traffic in UK ports, enabling us to analyze the correlation with harbor sizes.


## Steps to run the code
1. Create an environment from environment.yml
2. Activate environment
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook
